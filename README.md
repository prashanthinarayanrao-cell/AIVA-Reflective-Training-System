## Overview

**AIVA Reflective Training System** is an AI-powered instructional framework designed to simulate the experience of an intelligent human mentor.  
It transforms static training content into adaptive learning experiences that guide users through **API calling, annotation, chatbot communication, and data labeling** concepts with clarity, feedback, and reflection.  

AIVA blends **Instructional Design**, **Reflective Learning**, and **Conversational AI** to make training interactive, self-paced, and conceptually strong.

## Learning Approach

| Step | Approach | Explanation |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Introduce → Explain → Confirm → Reflect → Reinforce** | A structured, reflective learning cycle. |
| 2 | **Micro-Learning Segments** | Each topic is divided into short, focused parts. |
| 3 | **Real-World Analogies** | Uses examples like restaurants, shopping, and APIs. |
| 4 | **Learner Control** | The learner progresses by pressing Enter after each step. |
| 5 | **Understanding Checks** | Each section ends with a comprehension question. |
| 6 | **Summarization and Reflection** | Reinforces key takeaways before returning to the starter list. |

## Methodologies Used

| Methodology | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Reflective Learning (Kolb’s Experiential Model)** | Learners experience, reflect, conceptualize, and apply knowledge through guided questioning. |
| **Conversational Learning Approach** | Knowledge is shared through natural dialogue and relatable analogies. |
| **Socratic Questioning** | Prompts learners to think critically rather than memorizing answers. |
| **Instructional Design Framework (ADDIE)** | Each concept follows Analysis → Design → Development → Implementation → Evaluation. |
| **Microlearning Strategy** | Focused, small lessons ensure high retention and minimal overload. |
| **Human–AI Co-Learning** | Continuous interaction between learner and AI enhances engagement and self-learning. |
| **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)** | When confusion arises, AIVA probes deeper using the “Why” technique to ensure conceptual clarity. |

## Developer Setup (Custom GPT Integration)

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | Upload `AIVA Playbook` and `Training Material` into the GPT knowledge base. |
| 2 | Add all 12 Conversation Starters individually in the GPT Builder (each in its own input box). |
| 3 | Paste the `AIVA_Custom_GPT_Setup_Manual.docx` content into the **Instructions** field. |
| 4 | Configure the system so all 12 starters appear simultaneously when the session begins. |
| 5 | After each topic is completed, display the full list of starters again automatically. |
